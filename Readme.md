# Clean Energy Backend

The Electricity Bill Management System is created using the MERN stack. This is the backend code of the application. This system manages the electricity billing by providing a seamless interface for users to view, pay, and track their electricity consumption and bills.

It is powered by Node.js and Express.js for efficient data handling, while MongoDB stores user, billing, and payment information.
